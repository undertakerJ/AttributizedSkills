## Description

Attributized Skills is a fork of the [RpgSkillable mod](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=RpgSkillable+curseforge) that was abandoned. Thanks to the license and permission statement of the author, this mod was possible.

Major differences in Attributized Skills include:

 New custom menu
  
  Skills are now attributes
  
  New textures
  
  New bonus system
  
  Additional compatability with mods

  And more!
